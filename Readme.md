# Flutter Exam 2 - Make a simple flutter app of your own design

## App Description
The application I decided to make for Exam 2 is a useful weather application. This application takes
the current location of the device and gathers weather data as well as a five day forecast. The application
lists useful weather information and provides icons in an appealing format to the user.
